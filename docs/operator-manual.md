## Overview

The keyhub-vault-operator uses a policy based mechanism to access KeyHub vault records. These policies are stored in a KeyHub vault. The client credentials in the keyhub-vault-operator-secret Secret are used to access the policy vault. The policy vault lists additional client credentials (username/secret fields) to be used to access vaults based on policies defined in the comment field.

These KeyHub applications must have the Give access to accounts and setup of groups option ticked. The keyhub-vault-operator reads the groups the application is linked to. All vault records in the vaults of the linked groups are available in the KeyHubSecret CR.

## Policies
A policy defines a mapping between Kubernetes and a KeyHub OAuth2/OIDC application to be used to retrieve vault records. Currently only namespace-based policies defining a name or a label selector are supported, e.g.:

```yaml
policies:
  - type: namespace
    name: default
  - type: namespace
    labelSelector: field.cattle.io/projectId=p-xxxxx
```
