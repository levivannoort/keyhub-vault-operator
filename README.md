# Topicus - KeyHub Vault Operator

The KeyHub Vault Operator can be used in conjuction with a Topicus KeyHub instance, to be able to synchronize records in a KeyHub vault to Kubernetes secrets. It does so through a policy based mechanism, which are stored in a KeyHub vault. 

To define a mapping between KeyHub and Kubernetes a `KeyHubSecret` custom resource can be created. The name of the generated Kubernetes Secret is the same as the name of the KeyHubSecret. The mapping between a secret key and a vault record is based on the uuid of the vault record. Secrets will be automatically synchronized with a 10 minute interval. In case of an error the retry interval is 2 minutes.

## Installation

Although the KeyHub Vault Operator can be installed within the kubernetes cluster without the pre-requisites, it wont function if the following things aren't present:
- Accessible KeyHub instance.
- Configuration of KeyHub components (e.g. vaults, OIDC applications, policy, records).
- Kubernetes secret with the client credentials (i.e. `keyhub-vault-operator-secret`), used to access the policy vault.

The following kustomize file can be applied to the Kubernetes cluster for the installation of the controller.
```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: keyhub-vault-operator

resources:
- ssh://github.com/topicuskeyhub/keyhub-vault-operator//config/default?ref=main
```
## Configuration

- [user-guide](docs/user-guide.md) - describes using the operator from an application/user perspective.
- [operator-manual](docs/operator-manual.md) - describes using operator from a keyhub/operator perspective.

## Release
Manually run the `release` workflow (branch `main`) from Github Actions. This will create a release which in turn is the trigger for the `build-and-publish` workflow.

The `release` workflow will do the following:

```
Updates the 'images['controller'].newTag' in 'config/manager/kustomization.yaml' with the full semver (prefixed with a 'v'), e.g. 'v0.1.0'. The semver is based on conventional commits and the latest git tag. Create and push the release tag, e.g. 'v0.1.0'. Create a GitHub release with a changelog based on the (conventional) commits since the last release.
```

The `build-and-publish` workflow will do the following.

```
Build and publish the image from the release tag.
```

## Development - requirements

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster. This project uses the [operator sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/), which is a framework that uses the controller-runtime library to make writing operators easier (it provides high level apis, abstractions, scaffolding, code genration and lastly extensions). Additionally the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) can be installed and configured to enforce the standardization of commit message, where the conventional commit standard is used, which can be configured with a [pre-commit-script](https://github.com/compilerla/conventional-pre-commit) in the following way:

```console
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

## Development - getting started

Run the operator (note: the controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file, i.e., whatever cluster kubectl cluster-info shows):
```
make run
```

Run the tests:
```
make test
```
